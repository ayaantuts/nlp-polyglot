# nlp-polyglot
A web-based platform where users can input text (in various languages) and apply a suite of NLP models to it for analysis. It's like a Swiss Army knife for text, providing useful insights and visualizations. This project is perfect because it's modular, allowing contributors to add new models or features without breaking existing ones.
